        <h2>CO2 Emissions Data Visualization</h2>
        <h3>Final Project for ARTG 5300</h3>
        <p>
            There are two datasets compared on this small multiples chart. Data n.1 is CO2 emission per capita,
            <br>while
            data n.2 is annual CO2 emissions. There will be multiple layers of contextual information analised <br> in
            this visualization - such as the population and the current GDP of each country.
            The chart depicts 10 countries.<br> They were chosen according to the population -
            above 5 million. Data about the GDP and population was gathered <br>from the World Bank website, while the
            data about C02 emissions was gathered from the Our World in Data page.
