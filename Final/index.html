        <h2>CO2 Emissions Data Visualization</h2>
        <h3>Final Project for ARTG 5300</h3>
        <p>
            There are two datasets compared on this small multiples chart. Data n.1 is CO2 emission per capita,
            <br>while
            data n.2 is annual CO2 emissions. There will be multiple layers of contextual information analised <br> in
            this visualization - such as the population and the current GDP of each country.
            The chart depicts 10 countries.<br> They were chosen according to the population -
            above 5 million. Data about the GDP and population was gathered <br>from the World Bank website, while the
            data about C02 emissions was gathered from the Our World in Data page.

        <p>In the legend box I will show a close up pictures of a single small multiple from the chart and define what
            design elements mean in the chart and what the symbols stand for. This paragraph will provide more
            information about the relationship between datasets. It will explain the connection between population, GDP,
            and the CO2 emissions.
