        <h2>CO2 Emissions Data Visualization</h2>
        <h3>Final Project for ARTG 5300</h3>
        <p>
            The visualization below shows the relationship between the annual CO2 emissions per capita and the
            <br>population. The chart shows top 10 countries with population above 5 million. Additional layers<br>
            information are the GDP and total annual emissions of each country. All data is from the year 2020.<br>
            The aim of the visualization is to depict the correlation between population and the amount of CO2 <br>
            emissions. <br>
            from the World Bank website, while thedata about C02 emissions was gathered from the Our World in Data page.

        <p>In the legend box I will show a close up pictures of a single small multiple from the chart and define what
            design elements mean in the chart and what the symbols stand for. This paragraph will provide more
            information about the relationship between datasets. It will explain the connection between population, GDP,
            and the CO2 emissions.
